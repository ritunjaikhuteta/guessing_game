🎯 C Number Guessing Game

A simple terminal-based number guessing game written in C. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback — "Too high!" or "Too low!" — until the correct number is guessed.

### 🧠 Features
- Random number generation using `rand()` and `srand()`
- Hint system after every guess
- Count of attempts
- Clean and beginner-friendly code

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Compile the code using `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc guessing_game.c -o guessing_game
# guessing_game
